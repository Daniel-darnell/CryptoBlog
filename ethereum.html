            Thank you for going through the Bitcoin article, and it gets even better for you guys. <br> In this page we will look at nitty gritties of Ethereum.
        </p>

        <h1>ETHEREUM</h1>
        <p>
            What exactly is ethereum.
            <br> Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain.
            <br>Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Development was crowdfunded in 2014, and the network went live on 30 July 2015, with an initial supply of 72 million coins.
            he platform allows developers to build and operate decentralized applications that users can interact with.Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest.
            Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs, which are non-interchangeable tokens that can be connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as unique digital property. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20 tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized it for initial coin offerings.In 2016, a hacker exploited a flaw in a third-party project called The DAO and stole $50 million of Ether.
            <br>As a result, the Ethereum community voted to hard fork the blockchain to reverse the theft and Ethereum Classic (ETC) continued as the original chain.
            Ethereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition to proof of stake and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding.

        <p>The history of Ethereum is as captivating and informative as Bitcoin's lets take a dive in.</p>

        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
            Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications.Buterin argued that Bitcoin and blockchain technology could benefit from other applications besides money and needed a scripting language for application development that could lead to attaching real-world assets, such as stocks and property, to the blockchain.
            In 2013, Buterin briefly worked with eToro CEO Yoni Assia on the Colored Coins project and drafted its white paper outlining additional use cases for blockchain technology.
            However, after failing to gain agreement on how the project should proceed, he proposed the development of a new platform with a more general scripting language that would eventually become Ethereum
            Ethereum was announced at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, in January 2014.During the conference, Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, and Anthony Di Iorio (who financed the project) rented a house in Miami with Buterin to develop a fuller sense of what Ethereum might become.
            Di Iorio invited friend Joseph Lubin, who invited reporter Morgen Peck, to bear witness. Peck subsequently wrote about the experience in Wired.
            Six months later the founders met again in a house in Zug, Switzerland, where Buterin told the founders that the project would proceed as a non-profit. Hoskinson left the project at that time.
            Ethereum has an unusually long list of founders. Anthony Di Iorio wrote: "Ethereum was founded by Vitalik Buterin, Myself, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie & Amir Chetrit (the initial 5) in December 2013. Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood, & Jeffrey Wilcke were added in early 2014 as founders." Formal development of the software began in early 2014 through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (EthSuisse).[25] The basic idea of putting executable smart contracts in the blockchain needed to be specified before the software could be implemented. This work was done by Gavin Wood, then the chief technology officer, in the Ethereum Yellow Paper that specified the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
            Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public crowdsale from July to August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (Ether) with another digital currency, Bitcoin. While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.
            In 2019, Ethereum Foundation employee Virgil Griffith was arrested by the US government for presenting at a blockchain conference in North Korea.

        <h2>THE ETYMOLOGY OF ETHEREUM</h2>
        <p>
            Buterin chose the name Ethereum after browsing a list of elements from science fiction on Wikipedia. He stated, "I immediately realized that I liked it better than all of the other alternatives that I had seen; I suppose it was the fact that [it] sounded nice and it had the word 'ether', referring to the hypothetical invisible medium that permeates the universe and allows light to travel.
            Buterin wanted his platform to be the underlying and imperceptible medium for the applications running on top of it.
        </p>
        <h3>THE LAUNCH AND MILESTONE OF ETHEREUM</h3>
        <p>
            Several codenamed prototypes of Ethereum were developed by the Ethereum Foundation as part of their proof-of-concept series. "Olympic" was the last prototype and public beta pre-release. The Olympic network provided users with a bug bounty of 25,000 Ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain. In July 2015, "Frontier" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform.
            <br>
            Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or incentive structures of the platform.
            Protocol upgrades are accomplished by means of a hard fork. The latest upgrade to Ethereum was "Berlin", implemented on April 14, 2021.
            The next upgrade, "London", is slated to be launched in July. London will include Ethereum Improvement Proposal ("EIP") 1559, which will destroy Ether that is used for transaction fees as opposed to providing them to miners, potentially decreasing the overall supply.

            Awesome read right? Well cryptocurrency just like any other thing has solicited mixed reactions, with those that are in supported looking at the blockchain
            positive perks of cryptos, with those againsts it also having their fair share of reasons why cryptos are not just it.
            Are you for or against cryptos? well you be the judge of that but for now, let's head over to the <a href="tweets.html">Reviews</a> section and see other people's thoughts on cryptos.
