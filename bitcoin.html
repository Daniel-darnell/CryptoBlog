                <p>
                    We have already looked what Cryptos are an example of a cryptocurrency is the <b>Bitcoin</b>.
                    So what are Bitcoins?
                    <br> <b>Bitcoin(₿) </b>  is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
                    The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
                    but the real-world value of the coins is extremely volatile.Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.
                    Users choose to participate in the digital currency for a number of reasons: ideologies such as commitment to anarchism, decentralization and libertarianism, convenience, using the currency as an investment and pseudonymity of transactions. Increased use has led to a desire among governments for regulation in order to tax, facilitate legal use in trade and for other reasons (such as investigations for money laundering and price manipulation).
        
                    Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint">carbon footprint</a>) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists and commentators have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment, although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.

                <h2> <i>Creation</i> </h2>
                <p>
                    The domain name "bitcoin.org" was registered on 18 August 2008.On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
                    On 31 October 2008, a link to a paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
                    was posted to a cryptography mailing list. Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.
                    <br> On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. Embedded in the coinbase of this block was the text "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".This note references a headline published by The Times and has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking
                    The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who had created the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004.
                    Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto.Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit gold
                    In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000.
                    <br> Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation.
                    Andresen then sought to decentralize control. This left opportunity for controversy to develop over the future development path of bitcoin, in contrast to the perceived authority of Nakamoto's contributions.
                    After early "proof-of-concept" transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as Silk Road. During its 30 months of existence, beginning in February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting 9.9 million in bitcoins, worth about $214 million
                    In 2011, the price started at $0.30 per bitcoin, growing to $5.27 for the year. The price rose to $31.50 on 8 June. Within a month, the price fell to $11.00. The next month it fell to $7.80, and in another month to $4.77
                    In 2012, bitcoin prices started at $5.27, growing to $13.30 for the year.By 9 January the price had risen to $7.38, but then crashed by 49% to $3.80 over the next 16 days. The price then rose to $16.41 on 17 August, but fell by 57% to $7.10 over the next three days
                    <br> The Bitcoin Foundation was founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin's development and uptake.
        
                    <br> <br> Let's take a look at the structure and design of the bitcoin.

                <p>
                    Bitcoin is based on an elliptic curve called secp256k1 and encrypted with the ECDSA algorithm.Bitcoin has a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would add support for Schnorr signatures
